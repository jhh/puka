It's a great basic method for cooking beets, though it doesn't, on its own, give you the caramelized flavors one often expects from \"roasting.\" Because beets are so hard and dense, it's best to cook them with a little steam to keep them from burning. If you want that caramelization, follow the steps below. The spices, too, add a wonderful, subtle background note to the beets but are not strictly necessary.",

The quickest, easiest, short-cut method is what I describe here (and the only way some of my Brazilian friends make it). You put the ingredients in a blender. Pour them out into a mini-muffin tin, and bake. The beauty of this recipe is that you can make a big batch of batter and just store it in the refrigerator (for up to a week), pouring out just as many mini-muffins as you want to eat. You can even cook them in a toaster oven.",

    "description": "Given chicken's tendency to become dry during cooking, I'd suggest one of two options: Use all drumsticks and thighs; these will flavor the fennel brilliantly, remain moist even if you overcook them slightly, and give you the crunchiest skin. (If you separate drumstick from thigh at the joint, a simple cut, you'll also reduce cooking time by about 10 minutes.) Or cut up a whole chicken. If you do this, cut apart the drumsticks and thighs so they cook almost as quickly as the breast pieces. Even then, you may want to remove the breasts early to keep them from drying out.",

Never once did it stutter or complain or fail to take an image when I asked it to. And only rarely did it take the wrong image.\n\nThe compact combination of Panasonic's GF1 body and the 20mm f1.7 Lumix pancake lens works with you as a traveler. It's a light, sturdy, capable, exceptionally well conceived photography kit that demands to be taken on adventures.",

The type of camera you have will determine which image set you are able to shoot, but either set will capture about a 10EV dynamic range. It is very hard to see a difference between the 2EV and 1EV spacing so don’t fight what you camera was built for. I refer to this bracketing sequence as the Workhorse Set because it is used for the majority of HDR photography and will capture the full dynamic range for most scenes.",

Then make a roux, heating butter and flour together until they darken. Whisk the stock into the roux until it’s thick, then refrigerate. When you are ready to serve, just reheat it. Presto!

The term \"debugger\" may be somewhat of a misnomer for hfsdebug, because a key feature (rather, a limitation) of it is that it operates on an HFS+ volume only in read-only mode. Therefore, it cannot currently be used by itself to repair any defects in a volume, or to even write to a volume in any manner whatsoever. Nevertheless, hfsdebug is meant to be a useful tool in exploring HFS+ internals, as it allows you to browse, inspect, and analyze various aspects of HFS+ volumes. It can also calculate and display certain filesystem statistics. My original intent in creating hfsdebug was to quantify filesystem fragmentation under HFS+.",

This is useful, for instance, if an application which is installed by the operating system becomes damaged and needs to be reinstalled without the hassle of reinstalling all of Mac OS X. Pacifist is also able to verify existing installations and find missing or altered files*, and Pacifist can also examine the kernel extensions installed in your system to let you see what installer installed them, and whether the installer was made by Apple or a third-party.",

It also takes a look at some of the sumptuous design and the patchwork lore surrounding many of the bosses, explaining who they are, what they leave behind when they perish, and why it’s necessary to steal all of their souls. As such it’s absolutely riddled with spoilers, as well as strategies and a sprinkling of silliness.",

    "description": "I've been somewhat interested in Go for quite a while now. It's gotten to the point where it has replaced Ruby for me in those places where I write command line utilities which are too involved for them to make sense to be a shell script. I don't have too many opinions about the language itself, but I like the static type system and that it's a compiled language. And to be honest, the build system and how to utilize it have been the most interesting bits for me so far. One thing I especially like is the fact that go provides a bunch of tooling to do different things but how you tie them together is up to you. So this gives rise to some fun use cases for a nice Makefile.",

I use USB tethering to transfer information from the smartphone to the PC and from the PC to the smartphone. The problem is that every time USB tethering is activated, a new IP address (in the subnetwork 192.168.42.0/24) is assigned to the usb0 network interface created on the PC. This means that the application code running on the smartphone can't easily initiate a communication with the PC.",

    "title": "What is PIV servo control?",
    "description": "What is PIV servo control? It typically involves two components: feedforward control, which adds auxiliary velocity and (in some cases) acceleration signals to the servo loop in order to improve command tracking, and either PID or PIV control, which works to maximize the system’s disturbance rejection. The distinction between PID and PIV control is that PID control is based on position error, while PIV control is based on both position error and velocity error.",

My intention is to show how “new” (>= 3.0.0) features can be employed to reshape your CMake system into a more maintainable and intuitive alternative that actually makes sense.",

Cristian observed that this simple algorithm is probabilistic, in that it only achieves synchronization if the round-trip time (RTT) of the request is short compared to required accuracy.",
